It begins anew

3/20/19
I am learning this again. Starting from nothing. Forgetting all that I have learned before. Not jumping around this time and losing focus. I will do this. I can do this. I am excited to do this. It has been a little over a year since I last attempted this. I have failed several times at this. I am picking myself up and doing it again. This is for me. I am not doing this becasue I will get a new job. I am not doing this because someone thinks it is a good idea for me to do. I am doing this because it is something that I need to do and I am going to do.
